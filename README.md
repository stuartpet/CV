<span style="font-size: .7rem">
Software developer since August 2019 after a successful career change and graduating from Makers Academy. Previously 20 plus years working in the regulated financial industry with experience working in start-ups, mid-cap, and large corporate organisations.

<span style="font-size: .7rem">I have a passion for code and am a natural problem solver. Highly motivated with a huge will to learn and continually expand knowledge. I strongly believe that a good software developer is a collaborative developer who wants to pass on accumulated knowledge and strives to understand and learn holistic software development knowledge, not only a single specialized field area (eg aiming to develop T-shaped skills).

### Career History

**Smart Pension** (August 2019 - present)
Smart Pension is a pensions and retirement technology business, delivering pensions technology platforms in partnership with other financial institutions, and running a defined contribution master trust pension scheme set up for employers to enroll employees in a workplace pension scheme.

* Mid Level Ruby Developer (London)                                                   
Implemented features across multiple global platforms used by financial institutions, advisors, and employers, significantly enhancing the end-user experience and streamlining operations.

  **Recent work**:
  
  **Modularisation of the monolith using rails engines to split it into domains**
   * I was responsible for extracting the business logic related to benefit creation from the 10+ years monolith into an engine with extra  
   work to prepare it for moving to a service. This reduced the number of PRs requiring external review by 23% and made the onboarding of 
   new developers much easier.
    
  **Store multiple sensitive bank account numbers securely**
   * The original design was created to support only one sensitive account per resource. To store multiple bank accounts per resource we 
    needed to decouple the bank account details in the Vault from the single resource and allow them to
    be saved with a UUID meaning we can save multiple sensitive account details to one resource.
 
  * This approach meant refactoring not only the way we save the data to the Vault but also the way we retrieve it across the platform
    where this data was required.
