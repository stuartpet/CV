<span style="font-size: .7rem">
Software developer since August 2019 after a successful career change and graduating from Makers Academy. Previously 20 plus years working in the regulated financial industry with experience working in start-ups, mid-cap, and large corporate organisations.

<span style="font-size: .7rem">I have a passion for code and am a natural problem solver. Highly motivated with a huge will to learn and continually expand knowledge. I strongly believe that a good software developer is a collaborative developer who wants to pass on accumulated knowledge and strives to understand and learn holistic software development knowledge, not only a single specialized field area (eg aiming to develop T-shaped skills).

### Career History

**SmartPension** (August 2019 - present)
Smart Pension is a pensions and retirement technology business, delivering pensions technology platforms in partnership with other financial institutions, and running a defined contribution master trust pension scheme set up for employers to enroll employees in a workplace pension scheme.

* Mid Level Ruby Developer (London)                                                   
Developed and implemented Ruby on Rails features across multiple global platforms used by financial institutions, advisors, and employers, significantly enhancing end-user experience and streamlining operations.

* Recent work:
  * modularisation of the monolith using rails engines to split it into domains.
  Before migrating any of the units from the monolith to the engine, we moved all technical requirements Constants, Packwerk, Zeitwerk, 
  Containers the core model(s) the model’s factory and specs and updated any references to this model throughout the monolith

  At Smart, we use an EntryPoint and Units setup which means the migration of each unit was split into 3 sub-tasks:
  * move any models, associated specs and factories, and references to the moved model
  * move queries and dependencies
  * move units, sub-tasks, authorizers, validators, forms and associated specs

  We then performed some post-modularisation tasks using packwerk's to-do list function.
    
  * The introduction of a feature to allow users to input bank details into a secure vault for use with pension payments
